<p style="font-size: 14px">This calculator lets performers, their representatives and employers quickly calculate the appropriate use fee
 for voiceover artists in radio commercials. </p>
 <br/>
 <p style="font-weight: bold">Adding stations to your selection</p>
 <p style="font-size: 14px">You can search for stations by name or by type. When searching by name, enter the first few letters of the name 
 and all matching stations will be shown. Once you have found a station you wish to add, simply click 
 on it in the box labelled "Stations Alphabetically" and they will be added to the set of selected stations.</p>
 <br/>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">View discounts</p>
 <p style="font-size: 14px">Many discounts of various types apply to different groups of stations, so we've provided you with two totals, 
 the total after discounts have been applied and a total without discounts. You can get a breakdown of the applied 
 discounts by clicking on "details" over the box showing the total with discounts.</p>
 <br/>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">Removing stations from your selection</p>
 <p  style="font-size: 14px">To remove a selected station, simply click on the station in the box labelled "Selected Stations".</p>
